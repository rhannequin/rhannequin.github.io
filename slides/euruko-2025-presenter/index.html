            <li>Learning in public is about sharing what you learn</li>
            <li>Structuring your thoughts</li>
            <li>And getting feedback from others</li>
            <li>It is a great way to share where your interests are</li>
            <li>It can inspire others</li>
            <li>And it favours feedback and collaboration</li>
            <li>You can start with small things</li>
            <li>Like a toot on Mastodon about something you just learnt</li>
            <li>Yes, it's very unlikely you are the first person to learn this</li>
            <li>But it doesn't matter</li>
            <li>If you just learnt it, then you have already a bit more experience to share with the rest of the world
            </li>
            <li>Write a blog post about a feature you developed or a problem you solved</li>
            <li>You can also do a podcast episode and just talk about anything that got you excited recently</li>
