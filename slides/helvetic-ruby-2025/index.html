          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Let's start with a hard truth. The sky you see is not what you
              think it is. It is a lie.

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Because the speed of light is finite, everything we see is at
              least slightly in the past. When it comes to astronomy, delay can
              be seconds, minutes, days, years.

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              The atmosphere refracts light so much that when we witness a
              Sunset, the Sun has actually set below the horizon for several
              minutes.

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              From our perspective, the Pole Star slightly wobbles around the
              celestial pole. Thousands of years ago, another star was way
              closer to this point.

            <p>
              The Earth rotates around its axis in 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4
              seconds. What we use in everyday life is called a mean solar day,
              because the actual solar day varies throughout the year.

              Astronoby is a Ruby gem I started working on a couple years ago

              So far it provides the position of major Solar System bodies,

              solstices. You can also compute the phases of the Moon.

            <p>
              To compare two different programming languages, Python and Ruby
              are very close to each other, except some syntax differences and
              some features, they can basically do the same. But Ruby is not
              known for its scientific ecosystem, Python is. Ruby deserves to
              have scientific projects to inspire others to contribute to the
              ecosystem as one where science can happen.

              The goal is not to only write algorithms in Ruby but lso to write

              We have to deal with different time scales, different definitions
              of a position, apply the right corrections to the right objects,
              and deal with coordinates conversions.

              How to keep up with so many different notions? You need to define

              right correction on the right object and extract the right data
              from it.

              Domain-Driven Design is a development approach that focuses on
              creating systems that deeply reflect the underlying business
              domain they serve.

            <p>
              The main philosophy is to focus on the core domain, its logic, its

            <p>
              Domain-Driven Design fundamentally shifts how we approach software
              development. Instead of organizing code around technical concerns
              like databases and UI layers, DDD encourages us to structure our
              systems around the actual business concepts and processes they
              represent.
            </p>
            <p>
              We move away from monolithic models and technical jargon, toward
              bounded contexts with explicit boundaries and a shared language
              that both developers and business experts use consistently.
            </p>
            <p>
              The code itself becomes a reflection of how the business thinks
              and operates. Instead of treating all objects the same way, we
              distinguish between identity-based entities and attribute-based

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Ubiquitous language is one of the main points of DDD.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be honest I didn't know the word "ubiquitous" before I learnt
              about DDD, which means "existing or being everywhere at the same
              time".
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea is to use a shared vocabulary that both developers and
              business experts understand. This helps to avoid confusion and
              miscommunication, ensuring that everyone is on the same page.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the case of Astronoby, domain experts could be scientists
              interested in contributing to the project and having the
              scientific knowledge.

              Instead of using technical jargon like "MoonState" and "compute"
              in the example on the left, which might make sense in to the
              developers or in some design patterns, we use a more descriptive
              name like "MoonPhase" and "full_moon" which refer to the actual
              business concept of a full moon.

            <p>
              When the domain is complex and collaboration is important between
              the business knowledge and the technical skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your business experts can't recognize their own concepts and
              workflows in your code structure, you might be missing notions
              or abstract too much. But only if you are interested in this kind
              of collaboration.

              Ruby is particularly well suited for DDD because of its
              object-oriented nature and its expressiveness. It allows us to
              create clear and concise representations of domain concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
              The use of modules in Ruby allows us to create reusable and
              composable components and to establish clear and semantic
              boundaries between different parts of the codebase.
            </p>
            <p>
              Metaprogramming can be used to create domain-specific languages
              that make the code more expressive and easier to read.

              They are used to retrieve and store entities.

            <p>
              In Astronoby, Ephem holds the raw data. Its purpose is not

              The <code>Ephem</code> module is responsible for loading external
              data and making it available as raw vectors that the rest of the
              library will use and transform.
            </p>
            <p>
              The method <code>position_at</code> computes a position vector
              which is the distance from Solar System barycenter to the object
              in the 3-dimensional space.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a repository, it is not responsible for any transformation or

              We first have an <code>ephem</code> that loads the raw data from
              an ephemeris file. In DDD, it is a repository.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, we have <code>instant</code>, a value object that
              represents a point in time. It handles the conversion of this time
              in different time scales when needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>geneva</code> is an entity. It represents an observer here
              in Geneva, defined by their GPS coordinates. Note that each
              element is a value object as a separation of concerns. The
              observer represents a bounded context, and its components handle
              their own values.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, we have the <code>sun</code>, an entity generated from the
              transformation of raw data from the <code>ephem</code> repository
              depending on the <code>instant</code> constraint.
            </p>
            <p>
              This entity exposes a method <code>observed_by</code> that
              generates a topocentric position, it describes a position in the
              sky centered on an observer on Earth. Note that I'm not using a
              synonym, but the actual term used by astronomers.
              <br>
              This method could actually be seen as a domain service. I
              preferred to keep it in the entity to have areadable API, but it
              could make sense to have a dedicated domain service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, the generated <code>topocentric</code> object is also
              kind of a value object. It exposes its position through different
              coordinates types.
              <br>
              <code>horizontal</code> is the type we want to describe where the
              Sun is in the sky up and down, left and right, which itself,
              again, exposes attributes as value objects.

              I am not advocating for following this pattern constantly, but in

              <code>Time</code> is a good example of a value object in the Ruby
              standard library. It encapsulates a point in time and provides
              methods to access its components like hour, minute.
            </p>
            <p>
              Generally value objects are immutable, while <code>Time</code>
              exposes several methods that modify the object, so it is not an
              absolute value object.

              Value objects are useful when integrated in logic or formulas.
              With value equality, you can compare them without having to
              worry about their identity or their format, which is the default
              in Ruby
            </p>
            <p>
              Here we can instantiate two different objects that represent the
              same physical value, therefore they should be seen as equal.
            </p>
            <p>
              They can be manipulated together, leading to new objects that
              represent the result of the operation.

              By just adding the <code>Comparable</code> module and implementing
              the spaceship operator, your can easily implement your own value
              object. You can add arithmetic methods like we showed in the
              <code>Distance</code> object, but be careful with the unit of
              resulting operations. For example, adding two distances creates a
              new distance, while multiplying two distances creates an area,
              which is a different physical notion.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also use the newly <code>Data</code> class, introduced in
              Ruby 3.2, that natively supports value equality and provides a
              nice syntax to define your own value objects.

              Here is an example of a formula that computes the altitude of a
              celestial body. It deals with different notions like the
              declination, latitude or hour angle, but it is not necessary to
              know what they are to understand the formula.
            </p>
            <p>
              The code is difficult to read and understand, angles need to be

              verbose name for clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result, we have the altitude angle in degrees, which will
              probably be converted in other units later.

              With value objects, we can use the same formula without worrying

              While we are getting closer to the end of this talk, I think it is
              important to talk about testing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ruby is a dynamically typed language, which requires investment in
              testing to ensure the integrity of the code.

          <p>Well-defined objects</p>
          <p>Bounded contexts</p>
          <p>Real-life data</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Part of the DDD philosophy is to write testable code. Ruby is
              particularly well suited for this aspect due to the strong
              testing culture in the ecosystem and community.
            </p>
            <p>
              With well-defined objects and bounded contexts, it is easy to
              write tests that cover the different parts of the codebase.
            </p>
            <p>
              The use of real-life data in the tests allows testing the
              algorithms and the code in a realistic context, which is
              particularly important in a scientific context.

            <p>
              DDD is also a pragmatic choice for writing scientific code.
              Institutes and organizations provide data that can be used to
              test the algorithms and the code. They enforce the use of their
              own scientific domain, which is an opportunity but also a
              constraint. With my limited knowledge of real science, it is hard
              to know if the data is correct or not, so I need to rely on
              external sources to validate the results.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a screenshot from the IMCCE website, a French institute on
              celestial mechanics. The domain and vocabulary are approximately
              the same as the one used in Astronoby. It helped me test my
              results step by step, but also use correct concepts and
              algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
              This way, DDD helped having integrity and maintainability.

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              DDD is a great approach to write maintainable and readable code.
              Nothing in its philosophy prevents you from writing performant
              code but it can lead to performance issues if not used carefully.
              It is a matter of how you use it and how you design your code.

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              The important point is to define your priorities. With Astronoby,
              I wanted to focus on readability and accuracy. I implemented
              the scientific domain and laguage for accuracy and
              maintainability, and DDD helped me achieve that.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also want a library that is performant, I can achieve it, but I
              won't find guidance in DDD for this aspect.

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              To compute astronomical data, I need to find and test algorithms,
              implement them correctly and efficiently, and then optimise them
              if needed. DDD is not a magic wand, and in some perspectives, it
              can hurt the performance, for example by forcing to manipulate
              too many objects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some critical parts of the code can be optimised by using
              low-level interfaces like C extensions. It wouldn't go against DDD
              to use them, but it requires extra care to integrate them in a
              codebase written with a specific philosophy in mind.

              Many projects we all work on also have complex domains that
              require a clear understanding and implementation of the business
              concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
              To apply DDD to your own project, first identify your core domain.
              Talk to your stakeholders and document the key terms they use
              consistently.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, map the boundaries between different parts of your system.
              Where does one context end and another begin?
            </p>
            <p>
              Start small with value objects. Look for primitive obsession in
              your code, places where you're passing around strings, numbers, or
              IDs that actually represent domain concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Separate your data access from your business logic. This makes
              it easier to test and maintain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, remember that DDD is about making your code more
              expressive and maintainable, not about following rules perfectly.
              Prioritize what helps your team understand the domain.
