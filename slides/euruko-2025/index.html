          <p>Hook idea:</p>
          <p>
            Raise your hand if you have a folder on your computer called
            <code>projects</code>, <code>ideas</code> or <code>side</code>...
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, keep your hand up if you've touched a project in that folder in
            the last month.

          <p>This is a personal journey that can apply to anyone</p>
          <p>
            I'm going to talk a lot about myself, to provide concrete examples
            and not just ideas that are not actionable.

          <p>How it started</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Access astronomical data programatically</li>
            <li>Have them available in Ruby</li>
            <li>Explain them</li>
            <li>Make them accessible</li>

          <p>Doubts</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Who needs this?</li>
            <li>Is it worth the effort?</li>
            <li>
              This is hard and I'm not a real scientist (imposer syndrom)
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Example: geocentric to topocentric coordinates is way more
                  complex than anticipated
                </li>
                <li>
                  Example: turning barycentric vectors into topocentric
                  coordinates, how am I supposed to know how to do that?
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>I could spend this time working on business ideas instead</li>
            <li>
              Before ephemeris: results are just not good enough to compete,
              what's the point?
            </li>
            <li>
              Lots of effort to share and no feedback (new releases and blog
              posts that got no attention)
            </li>

          <p>Staying motivated</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Passion: it's easy to spend time on something that gots you
              excited
            </li>
            <li>
              Personal mission and challenge: Personal goals emerged as the
              project evolved (will to succeed, to learn, to share)
            </li>
            <li>
              Small quantity of project management: goals, celebrate wins, talk
              about it
              <ul>
                <li>
                  "Just like I wanted to lose weight, by telling others I
                  started eating healthier, I was more likely to stick to it.
                  Well, it didn't work, but it was worth trying."

              Examples from the community: Faker gem, started almost 7 years
              ago, initially a very niche need, now a very popular gem with
              hundreds of individual contributors, thousands of stars, used for
              testing, seeding, development, fun and more.

          <p>Niche can also be useful</p>
          <p>
            Because nobody's expecting anything, you can take your time, try
            things, make mistakes, put attention to details (nice API, tests).

            Realise you have things to say and share about the code and the
            journey: blogs, meetups, conferences, podcasts

          <p>(include screenshot of EuRuKo acceptance email)</p>
          <p>Show-case your new skills</p>
          <p>
            Most of my new achivements this year come from this project one way
            or another
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of us have great ideas and knowledge, this kind of project
            helps you share them

          <p>Actionable steps</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Put the code of one of your projects on GitHub publicly, add a
              README, share it with your friends and ask for one piece of
              feedback. You have no idea what could come next.
            </li>

        <section>
          <p>The rest depends on your goals</p>
          <p>
            I can't advise one way, I focused on some areas with Astronoby and
            I'm more than happy to share my experience, but what will make you
            happy depends on you.
