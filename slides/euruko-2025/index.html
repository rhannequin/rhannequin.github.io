              Let's start with a quick poll. Please raise your hand if you have
              a folder on your computer called <code>projects</code>,
              <code>ideas</code> or <code>side</code>...

              Yes, as expected, many of us.

              Now, keep your hand up if you've touched a project in that folder

              Let's start at the beginning.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love astronomy and I have been trying to do some coding and apps
              related to it for a while.

              But when I started, only a few data were available online, often
              in a format that was not easy to use.

              This is for example a screenshot from the great website Heavens
              Above, which provides a lot of data about the sky. The work done
              by the author Chris Peat is amazing, but as you can see this is
              HTML. If I wanted to access this data, I would have to scrape
              the website, which is not very nice, and quite a pain to do.

              I like the idea that astronomical data are universal and should
              be available to everyone. So I started investigating how Chris
              Peat was able to produce such precise data and if I could do it
              myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the idea grew on me, I started thinking that it would be
              great to have the code open source so that someone else could
              do the same if they wanted. And to try to explain how celestial
              mechanics work while I learnt some of it.

            Who needs to compute Moon phases in Ruby? Basically, nobody cares.
            I'm not saying this in a bitter way, it's just an objective fact.

              When I started my studies, I didn't know what I wanted to do. It
              turns out programming was giving me the same thrill of solving
              problems as my high school math exercises. This might be just me,
              I know I'm weird. But the sense of challenge, and the will to
              achieve my goal of providing astronomical data in Ruby, that got
              me excited.

              For example, the Faker gem, started almost 20 years ago, initially
              a very niche need, now a very popular gem with hundreds of

              SQLite it started as a small library to provide a lightweight

              First, you're going to learn a lot about open-source development.
            </p>
            <p>
              What is versioning, how do you deal with breaking changes?

              an important part with a lot of value for the community already,
              but it is more than that. It is about sharing knowledge,
              collaborating, and building a community around your project.

              An open-source library means people can use it, look into it,
              contribute to it, have opinions, and build on top of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              By making your project an open-source library, you are
              contributing to the community and you become responsible for
              some that didn't exist before.

              With your code being public, you might want to make it better,
              more efficient, more elegant. Either you are already a very
              experienced developer and you are going to show-off your skills.
              Or, you are going to learn on the way.

              How can I apply object-oriented programming principles to my
              algorithm? How can I design a nice API for the end-user? What if
              I try to apply domain-driven design principles to my code? What's
              the best way to test my code?

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Let me give you a couple examples of how I used Astronoby to how
              I applied some of these principles.
            </p>
            <p>
              This code comes from Astronoby v0.1.0, the first working version.
              To deal with angles, I had dedicated classes that were responsible
              for converting themselves from one unit to another.
            </p>
            <p>
              In use, it was not very convenient, as you had to convert
              angles to the same unit before comparing them.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <pre><code class="language-ruby">
    angle1 = Astronoby::Angle.from_radians(Math::PI)
    angle2 = Astronoby::Angle.from_degrees(90)

    angle1 == angle2
          </code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Then, I introduced value objects, a design pattern that
              encapsulates a value and its unit, so that you can compare
              angles regardless of their unit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that I also changed the method names to reflect that an
              angle stays an angle, regardless of its unit.

          <pre><code class="language-ruby">
            time = Astronoby::Epoch.to_utc(sun.epoch)

            sun
              .ecliptic_coordinates
              .to_equatorial(sun.epoch)
              .to_horizontal(
                time: time,
                latitude: latitude,
                longitude: longitude
              )
              .altitude
              .to_degrees
              .value
          </code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Here's another example, this time to illustrate how I applied
              domain-driven design principles to Astronoby.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first way to get the altitude in degrees of the Sun was long
              with many conversions, different ways to deal with time,
              inconsistent naming.

                  .degrees
          </code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Then, I focused on making a nice API for the end-user, oriented
              towards the domain. The developer doesn't have to deal with
              conversions, they just have to call the methods that make sense
              in the context of the problem they are trying to solve.

              Your project is an awesome opportunity to try and learn new
              things, what interests you and when you decide to work on it.

              Another great thing about side projects is that they create
              opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              It doesn't matter if it's niche, you actually have a lot to say
              and you're one of the few people who can say it.
            </p>
            <p>
              While working on your project, there are opportunities to share
              your ideas and your progress. You are going to have many blog post
              ideas. Why not talk about them in a podcast? Maybe do a meetup
              presentations.

              This is going to make you meet people, expand your visibility and

              Last year, someone contacted me on a social network about
              Astronoby, as they wanted to use it in their project. While I
              didn't get work with them specifically on Astronoby, I ended up as
              a consultant for thoughtbot on their project. This can be an idea
              to sell open source development time at your company, it might
              bring new client opportunities.

              One more point, you don't have to take yourself seriously. If this
              is niche and you feel like you are all alone doing your thing, it
              also means that you can take your time, try things, make mistakes.
              Nobody is expecting anything from you, so you can focus on what
              you want, either it's the code, the features, the sharing, the
              community, the fun, or all of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              And if you don't do side projects, that is very fine too. There
              many other occasions where perseverance and passion is welcome.

              Maybe we do need to be able to compute astronomical data in Ruby.
              Ruby is such a great language, so expressive, so elegant, but yet
              it is not used much in the scientific community. That can change
              now. We are all part of the Ruby community.

            I said earlier that nobody cares about computing Moon phases in
            Ruby. Turns out there is a weather application that very much needs
            it. And today, Astronoby is used in production by Hello Weather,
            a weather application with many users.
