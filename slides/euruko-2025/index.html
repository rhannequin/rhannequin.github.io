              Let's start with a quick poll. Please raise your hand if you have
              a folder on your computer called <code>projects</code>,
              <code>ideas</code> or <code>side</code>...
            </p>
            <p>
              Yes, as expected, many of us.

              But when I started, only a few data were available online, often

              This is for example a screenshot from the great website Heavens
              Above, which provides a lot of data about the sky. The work done
              by the author Chris Peat is amazing, but as you can see this is
              HTML. If I wanted to access this data, I would have to scrape
              the website, which is not very nice, and quite a pain to do.

              I like the idea that astronomical data are universal and should
              be available to everyone. So I started investigating how Chris
              Peat was getting was able to produce such precise data and if I
              could do it myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the idea grew on me, I started thinking that it would be
              great to have the code open source so that someone else could
              do the same if they wanted. And to try to explain how celestial
              mechanics work while I learnt some of it.

              Talking about doing it right, this is the classical imposter

              When I started my studies, I didn't know what I wanted to do. It

              I know I'm weird. But the sense of challenge, and the will to

              more likely to stick to it. Well, it didn't work, but it was worth

              First, you're going to learn a lot about open-source development.
            </p>
            <p>
              What is versioning, how do you deal with breaking changes?
            </p>
            <p>
              How do you manage dependencies and handle your own gem as a
              dependency for others?
            </p>
            <p>
              How important is documentation? How to maintain a changelog?
            </p>
            <p>
              How to write maintainable code? How to make it readable?
            </p>
            <p>
              How can you make your library accessible to everyone?
            </p>
            <p>
              Open-source is not just about writing public code. Well, this is
              an important part with a lot of value for the community already,
              but it is more than that. It is about sharing knowledge,
              collaborating, and building a community around your project.
            </p>
            <p>
              An open-source library means people can use it, look into it,
              contribute to it, have opinions, and build on top of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              By making your project an open-source library, you are
              contributing to the community and you become responsible for
              some that didn't exist before.

              With your code being public, you might want to make it better,
              more efficient, more elegant. Either you are already a very
              experienced developer and you are going to show-off your skills.
              Or, you are going to learn on the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              How can I apply object-oriented programming principles to my
              algorithm? How can I design a nice API for the end-user? What if
              I tryapply domain-driven design principles to my code? What's the
              best way to test my code?
            </p>
            <p>
              Your project is an awesome opportunity to try and learn new
              things, what interests you and when you decide to work on it.

              It doesn't matter if it's niche, you actually have a lot to say
              and you're one of the few people who can say it.
            </p>
            <p>
              While work on your project, there are opportunities to share your
              ideas and your progress. You are going to have many blog post
              ideas. Why not talk about them in a podcast? Maybe do a meetup
              presentations.

            <p>
              This is going to make you meet people, expand your visibility and
              create new opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Last year, someone contacted me on a social network about
              Astronoby, as they wanted to use it in their project. While I
              didn't get work with them specifically on Astronoby, I ended up as
              a consultant for thoughtbot on their project. This can be an idea
              to sell open source development time at your company, it might
              bring new client opportunities.

              One more point, you don't have to take yourself seriously. If this
              is niche and you feel like you are all alone doing your thing, it
              also means that you can take your time, try things, make mistakes.
              Nobody is expecting anything from you, so you can focus on what
              you want, either it's the code, the features, the sharing, the
              community, the fun, or all of it.

              As we often say, if it's useless, then it's indensible. The fact
              that you are doing it means that there is at least one person who
              needs it. And you will be surprised to see how many people are
              actually sharing your interest.

            I said earlier that nobody cares about computing Moon phases in

            it. And today, Astronoby is used in production by Hello Weather,
            a weather application with many users.

              I agree this one is hard, we often want to do things right and we
              are afraid of making mistakes. But there are many definitions of
              "right". By doing it your way, you are bringing your own style,
              your own vision. This might become the new "right" way.

              This one is my favourite because all your efforts are paying

              And finally I just don't like this one. Life is not always about
              productivity. Just enjoy the ride. If you really want to be
              productive, why not try to make a business out of this idea?

              It's true it's not always easy. You're going to face moments of

              not worth it.

            <p>
              But if you love it, if you are having fun, if you are learning,

              how much you can grow.
