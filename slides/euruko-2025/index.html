              a folder on your computer called <code>projects</code>,
              <code>ideas</code> or <code>side</code>...

              Yes, as expected, many of us.

            </p>
            <p>
              I love astronomy and I have been trying to do some coding and apps
              related to it for a while.

              But when I started, only a few data was available online, often in
              a format that was not easy to use.

              This is for example a screenshot from the great website Heavens
              Above, which provides a lot of data about the sky. The work done
              by the author Chris Peat is amazing, but as you can see this is
              HTML. If I wanted to access this data, I would have to scrape
              the website, which is not very nice, and quite a pain to do.

              I like the idea that astronomical data is universal and should be
              available to everyone. So I started investigating how Chris Peat
              was able to produce such precise data and if I could do it myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the idea grew on me, I started thinking that it would be
              great to have the code open source so that someone else could
              do the same if they wanted. And to try to explain how celestial
              mechanics work while I learn some of it.

              Who actually needs to compute Moon phases in Ruby? Basically,
              nobody cares. I'm not saying this in a bitter way, it's just an
              objective fact. It's already possible to do the same in Python for
              years, with way better performance and features.

              The classical is the classical imposter syndrome. I am not an

              This one sometimes hurts your feelings. Working hard on features,
              improvements, code quality, and it remains unnoticed. You know how

              witness it.

              I wrote a blog post after the biggest refactoring of Astronoby,

              When I started my studies, I didn't know what I wanted to do. It
              turns out programming was giving me the same thrill of solving
              problems as my high school math exercises. This might be just me,
              I know I'm weird. But the sense of challenge, and the will to
              achieve my goal of providing astronomical data in Ruby, that got
              me excited.

              These are things we don't always have the opportunity to work on
              in our day-to-day job. Once you publish a library, the public
              API is set in stone, and your own project becomes a dependency
              for others. This completely changes the way you think about
              your code and it is really exciting.

              want to help them understand your project, how to use it. You also

              In the Ruby community, we have a strong appeal for code quality

              You might be thinking "I have to learn all this??". Well, you
              don't <em>have to</em>, it will come naturally as you work
              on your project.

            <p>
              Open-source is not just about writing public code, even if there
              is already a lot of value for the community. It is about sharing
              knowledge, collaborating, and building a community around your
              project.
            </p>
            <p>
              An open-source library means people can use it, look into it,
              contribute to it, have opinions, and build on top of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              By making your project open-source, you are contributing to the
              community and you become responsible for some that didn't exist
              before.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is also a great way to enter the world of open-source at your
              own pace. You don't have to be a Rails contributor to be a Ruby

              These were questions I asked myself working on Astronoby and I
              would like to show you how your project can help you learn new
              concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
              This code comes from Astronoby, thefirst working version. To deal
              with angles, I had dedicated classes that were responsible for
              converting themselves from one unit to another.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yyou had to convert angles to the same unit before comparing the
              attribute <code>value</code>. It works but it's not very elegant.

    angle1 == angle2

            <p>
              Then, I introduced value objects, a design pattern that
              encapsulates a value and its unit, so that you can compare
              angles regardless of their unit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now I can use the equality operator to compare two angles without
              worrying about how they were initialised.

            <p>
              The first way to get the altitude in degrees of the Sun was long
              with many conversions. I can let you read the code but I bet it
              won't help you understand what's going on.
            </p>
            <p>
              It requires quite some knowledge already to get to the right

              Then, I focused on making a nice API for the end-user, oriented
              towards the domain. The developer doesn't have to deal with
              conversions, they just have to call the methods that make sense
              in the context of the problem they are trying to solve.
            </p>
            <p>
              I guess <code>horizontal</code> still needs some explaining, it a
              kind of coordinates up-and-down, left-and-right. But overall, the
              API is a tool to express the domain and give you answers instead
              of forcing you do some manipulations.

              Among other things, Astronoby taught me about value objects as I

            </p>
            <p>
              I also learnt on the way about how to deal with different

              One thing I strongly recommend is to learn in public. We are lucky
              to work in an industry where a lot of knowledge is shared
              publicly, and we can learn from each other.
            </p>

              Learning in public is about sharing what you learn, structuring
              your thoughts, and getting feedback from others.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is a great way to share where your interests are, it can
              inspire others, and it favours feedback and collaboration.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can start with small things, like a toot on Mastodon about
              something you just learnt. Yes, it's very unlikely you are the
              first person to learn this, but it doesn't matter. If you just
              learnt it, then you have already a bit more experience to share
              with the rest of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Write a blog post about a feature you developed or a problem you
              solved. You can also do a podcast episode and just talk about
              anything that got you excited recently.

              One more point, you don't have to take yourself seriously. If this
              is niche and you feel like you are all alone doing your thing, it
              also means that you can take your time, try things and make
              mistakes. Nobody is expecting anything from you, so you can focus
              on what you want, either it's the code, the features, the sharing,

              So, you are not wasting your time. You are having fun, you are
              learning, you are growing. You don't need appreciation to have a
              good time.

              As we sometimes say, if it's useless, then it's indispensable. The
              fact that you are doing it means that there is at least one person
              who needs it. And you will be surprised to see how many people are
              actually sharing your interest.

              Maybe we do need to be able to compute astronomical data in Ruby.
              Ruby is such a great language, so expressive, so elegant, but yet
              it is not used much in the scientific community. That can change
              now. We are all part of the Ruby community.

            It turns out there is a weather application that very much needs
            astronomical data. And today, Astronoby is used in production by
            Hello Weather.

              I agree getting rid of the imposter syndrome is hard. We often
              want to do things right and we are afraid of making mistakes. But
              there are many definitions of "right". By doing it your way, you
              are bringing your own style, your own vision. This might become
              the new "right" way.

              Finally, my favourite one is asking yourself if it's worth it. You
              are learning, you are growing, you are meeting people, you are
              having fun. So, yes, this is very much worth it.

              Don't be surprised if you develop a taste for it. I mentioned
              starting Astronoby 4 years ago, but in the last 10 months it made
              me hungry for more projects, and I'm now developing four other
              projects and as many occasions to learn new things.

              One day you might receive a GitHub issue with bad news and you
              will be incredibly happy just to have someone using your project.

            <p>
              So weird how someone finding performance issue in your code can
              make your day.

              Put it on GitHub publicly, add a README, share it with your
