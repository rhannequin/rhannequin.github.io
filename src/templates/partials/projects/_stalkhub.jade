  p.
    Stalkhub is a project to easily retreive information from
    <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> with are not directly
    available from the plateform. This idea comes from the fact that it
    can be hard to follow huge open-source projects. Watching issues and
    pull-requests doesn't make it easy to know what's really changing.
    Stalkhub can simplify this by showing the last commits of a project
    since the last visit. Other features are ready to be developed.
