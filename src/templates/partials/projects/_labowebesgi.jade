      This project is the website of the school association I ruled for
      years. It was a development-oriented association in which we were
      able to discuss and present topics around web development. This
      websites made it easier to create and manage events for students. It
      was built in Ruby with
      <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby On Rails</a> and is well
      test-covered.
