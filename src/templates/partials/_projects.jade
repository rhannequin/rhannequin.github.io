            easier fr developers to use their data.

          p.
            Ayouken is a mix between a bot and an API.

            is a JSON API which handle requests like displaying a tweet, getting
            a random gif or looking for documentation on
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">MDN</a>.
            I'm trying to build other projects to use this API to have a
            multi-plateform bot, like
            <a href="https://github.com/rhannequin/ayouken-gitter-client">ayouken-gitter-client</a>
            for <a href"https://gitter.im">Gitter</a> or

            This project is the website of the school association I ruled for
            years. It was a development-oriented association in which we were
            able to discuss and present topics around web development. This
            websites made it easier to create and manage events for students. It
            was built in Ruby with
            <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby On Rails</a> and is well
            test-covered.

          p.
            Stalkhub is a project to easily retreive information from
            <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> with are not directly
            available from the plateform. This idea comes from the fact that it
            can be hard to follow huge open-source projects. Watching issues and
            pull-requests doesn't make it easy to know what's really changing.
            Stalkhub can simplify this by showing the last commits of a project
            since the last visit. Other features are ready to be developed.

            Countdown Launch is a very small and useless project. Its only
            purpose is to create and diplay a countdown for an event. I only
            made it to have fun with friends with coming dates and events. It
            was built in Ruby with

            This is a small project based on
            <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com">Foursquare API</a> to
            retreive restaurants around you. You can restrict the results by
            giving your own taste or kind of food you want. This was the first
            part of an idea which was later giving birth to
            <a href="https://github.com/meet-for-meal/meetformeal">MeetForMeal</a>.
            It is only made of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
